                    I'm a frontend-focused fullstack software engineer with a sharp eye for design, performance, and user experience. I specialize in building modern, responsive web applications using technologies like React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with solid experience integrating APIs and managing backend services when needed. I love turning complex problems into clean, scalable interfaces that users actually enjoy.

                    Outside of work, I'm building Resonans â€” a side project driven by my passion for innovation and social impact. It's a platform that helps academic researchers translate their work into real-world change. Whether collaborating on fast-paced teams or launching something from scratch, I bring a product mindset, technical depth, and a drive to build things that matter.
